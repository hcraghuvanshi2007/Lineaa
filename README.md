### Favorites System
```javascript
// Example: Favorites data structure
const favoritesData = [
    { id: 1, name: "Silver Ring", type: "Ring", price: 149, image: "..." },
    { id: 2, name: "Gold Necklace", type: "Necklace", price: 249, image: "..." }
];

```

## 🎨 Customization Guide

### Change Brand Colors

Edit the CSS variables at the top of `<style>` tag in `index.html`:

```css
:root {
    --color-primary: #218080;           /* Main brand color */
    --color-primary-hover: #1a7472;     /* Hover state */
    --color-primary-active: #1a6873;    /* Active state */
    --color-text: #133435;              /* Primary text */
    --color-text-secondary: #626C7C;    /* Secondary text */
    --color-surface: #FFFDF9;           /* Card/surface backgrounds */
    --color-background: #FCFCF9;        /* Page background */
    --color-border: #E0D8CE;            /* Borders */
    --color-secondary: rgba(33, 128, 141, 0.12);
    --color-orange-500: #A84B2F;
}
```

### Update Product Images

Replace Unsplash URLs with your own images:

```javascript
const products = [
    {
        name: "Your Product Name",
        image: "https://your-image-url.jpg",
        category: "Rings"
    }
];
```

### Modify Collection Data

Edit the `collectionsData` array in the JavaScript section to add or remove product categories.

### Change Company Details

Update the footer section with your actual business information:

```html
<div class="footer-section">
    <h4>Visit Us</h4>
    <p>Your Address Here</p>
    <p>City, State ZIP Code</p>
</div>
```

- **Image optimization** = using responsive image URLs (Unsplash)

For production:
- Minify CSS and JavaScript
- Optimize images (WebP format, proper sizing)
- Add service workers for offline capability
- Implement lazy loading for images

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Images not loading?
- Check your internet connection (images are loaded from Unsplash CDN)
- Replace URLs with local image paths if needed

### Cart/Favorites data not persisting?
- Currently stored in JavaScript memory only
- Implement `localStorage` to persist across sessions:

```javascript
// Save to localStorage
localStorage.setItem('cartData', JSON.stringify(cartData));

// Load from localStorage
const savedCart = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('cartData') || '[]');
```

### Navbar dropdowns not working?
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
